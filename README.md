# Flight Data Analysis Project

## Description
This project involves analyzing flight data to uncover insights regarding flight cancellations, delays, and patterns in flight performance. The analysis uses various datasets related to flights, airports, and airlines, including cancellation rates, delay times, and geographical trends.

## Project Overview
I worked with three datasets:
- **Flights**: Contains information about each flight, including the airline, origin, destination, delays, cancellations, and more.
- **Airports**: Contains information about airports, such as airport codes and names.
- **Airlines**: Contains information about airline codes and names.

### Key Analysis Questions:
1. **Which airline had the highest percentage of delayed or canceled flights in 2015?**
2. **Which airports had the most flight cancellations?**
3. **Are there any geographical patterns in flight delays? Do certain airports experience more delays than others?**
4. **What was the average flight delay for each day of the week? Are weekends or weekdays more prone to delays?**

## Tools & Technologies:
- **Python (Pandas)**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Utilized for running and presenting the analysis.
